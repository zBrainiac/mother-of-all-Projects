/*  1. Acquiring weather data from Snowflake Marketplace
    ***********************************************************
    User-Guide:
    https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro
    ***********************************************************
    One of our Junior Analysts, Ben, wants to gain better insight into how the weather impacts our US food truck sales. 
    To do this, he'll use the Snowflake Marketplace to add weather data to our account and query it against our own TastyBytes 
    data to uncover some brand new insights.
    
    The Snowflake Marketplace provides a centralized hub where we can discover and access a wide variety of third-party data, 
    applications, and AI products. This secure data sharing empowers us to access live, ready-to-query data without duplication. 
    
    Steps to acquire Weather Source data:
    1. Ensure you are using accountadmin from the account level (check the bottom left corner).
    2. Navigate to the 'Data Products' page from the Navigation Menu. You can open this page in a new browser tab if preferred.
    3. In the search bar, enter: 'Weather Source frostbyte'.
    4. Select the 'Weather Source LLC: frostbyte' listing and click 'Get'.
    5. Click 'Options' to expand the options section.
    6. Change Database name to:'ZTS_WEATHERSOURCE'.
    7. Grant access to 'PUBLIC'.
    8. Press 'Done'.
    
    This process allows us to access Weather Source data almost instantly. By eliminating the need for traditional data 
    duplication and pipelines, our analysts can move directly from a business question to actionable analysis. 
    
    With the weather data now in our account, our TastyBytes analysts can immediately begin joining it with our existing location data.

/*  2. Integrating Account Data with Weather Source Data

    Before we start harmonizing our raw location data with data from the Weather Source share, we can query the data share
    directly to get a better sense of the data we're working with. We'll start by getting a list of all of the distinct cities available 
    in the weather data along with some weather metrics for that specific city.

/*  3. Explore Safegraph POI data

    Ben wants more insight to the weather conditions at our food truck locations. Luckily Safegraph provides free Point-of-Interest 
    data on the Snowflake Marketplace.
    
    To use this data listing, we'll follow a similar procedure that we did earlier for the weather data:
        1. Ensure you are using accountadmin from the account level (check the bottom left corner).
        2. Navigate to the 'Data Products' page from the Navigation Menu. You can open this page in a new browser tab if preferred.
        3. In the search bar, enter: 'safegraph frostbyte'
        4. Select the 'Safegraph: frostbyte' listing and click 'Get'
        5. Click 'Options' to expand the options section.
        6. Database name: 'ZTS_SAFEGRAPH'
        7. Grant access to 'PUBLIC'.
        8. Press 'Done'.
    
    By joining Safegraph's POI data with a weather dataset like Frostbyte's and our own internal `orders_v` table, we can identify 
    hi-risk locations and quantify the financial impact from external factors.

/*
    We want to use the location_ids from the last query to directly compare sales performance under different weather conditions.
    Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) we can use the query above as a subquery to find the top 3 locations with the highest 
    average wind speed and then analyze the sales data for those specific locations. Common Table Expressions help split up complex
    queries into different, smaller queries for improved readability and performance.
    
    We will split sales data for each truck brand into two buckets: 'calm' days, where the day's maximum wind speed was 20 mph or 
    less, and 'windy' days, where it exceeded 20 mph.

    The business impact of this is to identify a brand's weather resilience. By seeing these sales figures side-by-side,
    we can instantly spot which brands are 'weather-proof' and which see sales drop significantly in high winds.
    This allows for better informed operational decisions like running 'Windy Day' promotions for vulnerable brands,
    adjusting inventory, or informing future truck deployment strategy to better match a brand's menu to a
    location's typical weather.
