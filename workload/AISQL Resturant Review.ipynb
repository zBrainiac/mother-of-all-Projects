    "AISQL delivers an easy-to-use composable query language that handles both text and multimodal data through familiar SQL syntax. Our high-performance batch engine processes queries faster through intelligent query optimization, while delivering lower costs than traditional AI solutions. Natively ingest structured and unstructured data into unified multimodal tables, enabling comprehensive insights through familiar SQL analytics for all your data.\n",

    "## AI SQL Benefits:\n",
    "### 1) Easy-to-use SQL syntax to build AI pipelines without complex coding\n",
    "### 2) High-performance processing across all modalities (text, image, audio)\n",
    "### 3) Lower cost batch processing through optimized architecture to support faster and larger batch jobs.\n",
