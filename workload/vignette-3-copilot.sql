    We will assume the role of a TastyBytes data analyst with the intention of leveraging Snowflake Copilot 
    to build sophisticated queries and gain deeper business insights, so let's set our context appropriately.
*/

/* 1. Accessing Snowflake Copilot and Setting Up Context
    ***************************************************************
    Follow these steps to start using Snowflake Copilot:
    ***************************************************************/

-- before we start, we will set our context
USE ROLE tb_analyst;
USE WAREHOUSE tb_analyst_wh;
USE DATABASE tb_101;
USE SCHEMA harmonized;

/* 2. Requirement Translation with Copilot
    ***************************************************************
    To begin, let’s explore what types of analysis questions we can ask about our Tasty Bytes dataset 
    using Copilot’s natural language understanding capabilities. Type the following question in the Copilot 
    message box and click RUN to see the result of the query:
            
    Prompt 1: How do I structure a query that correlates customer review sentiment with customer loyalty metrics 
    and order behavior? I have a review sentiment data and customer loyalty metrics tables with order information. 
    I need to understand the relationship between what customers say and their actual purchasing pattern.
    ***************************************************************/

/*
    Key Inisght: 
        Copilot provides schema-aware business intelligence, directly analyzing your specific Tasty Bytes tables 
        and suggesting strategic analysis using your actual column names. This isn't generic AI; it's purpose-built 
        intelligence that profoundly understands your data structure.
*/

/* 3. Complex Query Building with Copilot
    ***************************************************************
    Now let’s use Copilot to generate complex SQL with multiple table joins from a simple business question.

    In the same Copilot panel, paste the following business question and click RUN to see the result:

    Prompt 2: Show me high-value customers who have been leaving negative reviews. I want to understand 
    which customers spend a lot of money with us but seem unhappy based on their feedback
    ***************************************************************/

/*
